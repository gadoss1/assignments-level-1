For this assignment, reference the last two articles. Make a site that tracks how many times the user has clicked anywhere on the page (or a specific button if you prefer) and displays that click count to the user. Then, using localStorage or sessionStorage, make it so the number of clicks will remain on the screen even after the site is refreshed.

**Extra credit:**Â Put a countdown timer (10-30 seconds) on the page that stops the user's clicks from counting towards the total after the timer ends.

// Set the time we're counting down to
//let countDownTime = new Time("00:00:00").getTime();

// Update the count down every 1 second
//let x = setInterval(function() {

  // Get today's time
  //let now = getTime()

  // Find the distance between now and the count down time
  //let distance = countDownTime - now;

  // Time calculations for days, hours, minutes and seconds
  //let hours = Math.floor((distance % (1000* 0)) / 1000)
  //let minutes = Math.floor((distance % (1000* 0) / 1000))
  //let seconds = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 10)) / 1000)

  // Display the result in the element with id="countdownTimer"
  //document.getElementById("countdownTimer").innerHTML =  hours + "h " + minutes + "m " + seconds + "s ";

  // If the count down is finished, write some text
  //if (distance < 0) {
    //clearInterval(x);
    //document.getElementById("countdownTimer").innerHTML = "EXPIRED"
  //}
//}//, //1000)
